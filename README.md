# pdinfo - Pandas Expanded Information Display

Being frustrated by not having one package to analyze a Pandas dataframe as I want, and developing the code for that, I decided to publish *pdinfo*, to save others time. 
It is inspired by packages like Sidetable and others and includes additional functionality and flexibility.

The first release includes functions to summarize a dataframe with lots of details, outlier detection, graphing, etc.

Following a standard installation, the functions are accessed through a Pandas accessor (.inf).
